		A spherical droplet of one liquid (phase 1) is surrounded by a
		semi-infinite liquid (phase 2). It is assumed that under all
		compositions of interest, the system remains two-phase and is
		not significantly altered, e.g. forming 1 or 3 phases instead.
		The two-phase system contains a surfactant component which
		starts uniformly distributed in either phase 1 or phase 2.
		The surfactant undergoes Fickian diffusion with a constant
		diffusivity.
		</p>
		<p>
		At the interface, the surfactant component can be adsorbed.
		There is an adsorption rate

        <p>
        In my first attempt, I tried to introduce an equilibration substep
        at each timestep in which I re-distributed mass between the Γ node
        and the C_0 node. However, I soon realized this is a bad approach.
        There is no physical process that equilibrates the interface with a
        slab of solution with thickness equal to the grid size.
        </p>
        <p>
        A more fruitful approach is to assert that C_0 is wholly slaved to
        Γ by the equilibrium relation, and that rather than redistributing
        mass between C_0 and Γ at each time step, Γ can be updated by a
        finite difference approximation of the flux onto the surface. I would
        like to make just one investigation: the sensitivity of the flux
        approximation to the number of nodes used in the finite difference
        calculation of the concentration derivative at the interface based on
        n nodes C_0, C_1, ... C_{n-1}.
